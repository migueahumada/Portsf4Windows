# Portsf for Windows
#### This is just a basic implementation of the Portsf audio library for Windows.

I don't own the library, in fact I got it from another github repo: https://github.com/bzgeb/portsf.

It's super nice and very intuitive for anyone that would like to learn audio programming.
Actually is used in **The Audio Programming Book by Boulanger, Lazzarini and Mathews**

>Warning!
>
>The .lib file created for windows in this project only supports build for **x86**.
>
>**If you want to change something of the .lib, go to the makefile and do your stuff.**

```Hope you like it```
